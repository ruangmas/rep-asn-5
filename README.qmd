In this assignment, you will learn to understand, run, and interpret regression results in Table 2 Panel A in *Defensive Investments and the Demand for Air Quality: Evidence from the NOx Budget Program* by Deschênes et al. (2017).

### **Part 1. Understanding the Methodology**

In the first part of this assignment, you will need to read **Section IV. Econometric Model** (pages 2969 - 2970) in the paper by Deschênes et al. (2017). You can find a copy of the paper in [here](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20131002). Afterward, you will need to answer the questions below.

We will focus on the regression equation

$$
Y_{cst} = \gamma_1 1(NBP Operating)_{cst} + W'_{cst}\beta+\mu_{ct}+\eta_{st}+\nu_{cs}+\epsilon_{cst}
$$

where $cst$ represents the unit of each observation in the data.

**Question 1: What is the unit of each observation in the data? (3 points)**

Answer:

The variable $NBPOperating_{cst}$ is a product of three dummy variables, $post_t \times nbp_c \times smm_s$.

$nbp_c$ is a dummy variable for NBP participating counties.

$smm_s$ is a dummy variable for the summer season.

**Question 2: What does the variable *post* represent? Why is *post* equal to 0.5 in the year 2003? (2 points)**

Answer:

**Question 3: What does the parameter of interest** $\gamma_1$ **represent? (1 point)**

Answer:

**Question 4: The variable** $\mu_{ct}$ **represents county-year fixed effects. Why do we have to include this factor in our analysis? (1 point)**

Answer:

**Question 5: The variable** $\eta_{st}$ **represents season-year fixed effects. Why do we have to include this factor in our analysis? (1 point)**

Answer:

**Question 6: The variable** $\nu_{cs}$ **represents county-season fixed effects. Why do we have to include this factor in our analysis? (1 point)**

Answer:

### Part 2. Preparing the Data

Step 1: Declare that you will use the **tidyverse** and **lfe** package. **(4 points)**

```{r}


```

Step 2: Upload **data.csv** into the Environment. **(2 points)**

Note: This is the same dataframe that Deschenes et al. (2017) used to run their regressions. It is download from the [replication package released by the authors](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/112938/version/V1/view).

```{r}

```

Step 3: Create a new variable called **post** that is equal to 0.5 in the year 2003 and equal to 1 in the years 2004 through 2007. Otherwise, **post** is equal to 0. (6 points)

```{r}

```

Step 4: The variable **fips** are county indicators. The script below creates a unique identifier for each county-season which will be used to represent $\nu_{cs}$ in the regressions.

You need to create another unique identifier for each season-year which will be used to represent $\eta_{ct}$ in the regressions. Name the new variable **smmXy**. (2 points)

```{r}
#| eval: false
df3<-df2 %>%
  mutate(smmXc = smm*as.numeric(fips)) 
```

Step 5: The script below creates a unique identifier for each state and year. Use the same method to create a unique identifier for each county-year. Name the new variable **cXy**. (2 points)

```{r}
#| eval: false
df4<-df3 %>%
  mutate(stXy = paste(state, "-", as.character(year)))
```

Step 6: Create a new variable that represents the variable $NBPOperating_{cst}$. Name the new variable **NBPOperating**. (3 points)

Hint: We discussed this in Part 1 Question 1.

```{r}

```

### Part 3: Running the Regressions

Answer Questions 1 to 3 based on the regression results below.

```{r}
#| eval: false
summary(m1<-lm(nox_emit ~ NBPOperating, data=df5))
```

**Question 1: According to the regression, the NOx Budget Program was able to reduce NOx emissions by \_\_\_\_\_\_ thousand tons per county-season. (1 point)**

**Question 2: According to the regression, the value of** $\gamma_1$ **is \_\_\_\_\_\_. (1 point)**

**Question 3: Can the regression produce an accurate estimate of the NBP's impact? If not, why? (2 points)**

Answer:

The script below adds weather controls to the regression. Answer Questions 4 to 6 based on the regression results below.

```{r}
#| eval: false
summary(m2<-felm(nox_emit ~ NBPOperating + 
                   dptp_xtile_1 + dptp_xtile_2 + dptp_xtile_4 + dptp_xtile_5 +
                   dptp_xtile_6 + dptp_xtile_7 + dptp_xtile_8 + dptp_xtile_9 +
                   dptp_xtile_10 + dptp_xtile_11 + dptp_xtile_12 + dptp_xtile_13 +
                   dptp_xtile_14 + dptp_xtile_15 + dptp_xtile_16 + dptp_xtile_17 +
                   dptp_xtile_18 + dptp_xtile_19 + dptp_xtile_20 + tmean_xtile_1 +
                   tmean_xtile_2 + tmean_xtile_4 + tmean_xtile_5 + tmean_xtile_6 +
                   tmean_xtile_7 + tmean_xtile_8 + tmean_xtile_9 + tmean_xtile_10 +
                   tmean_xtile_11 + tmean_xtile_12 + tmean_xtile_13 + 
                   tmean_xtile_14 + tmean_xtile_15 + tmean_xtile_16 + 
                   tmean_xtile_17 + tmean_xtile_18 +
                   tmean_xtile_19 + tmean_xtile_20 + mean_prcp, 
                 data=df5))

```

**Question 4: According to the regression, the NOx Budget Program was able to reduce NOx emissions by \_\_\_\_\_\_ thousand tons per county-season. (1 point)**

**Question 5: According to the regression, the value of** $\gamma_1$ **is \_\_\_\_\_\_. (1 point)**

### Column 1

The following regression will replicate the results in Table 2 Panel A Column 1. Because multiple fixed effects will be included, we will use the function *felm* instead of *lm*. Answer Questions 7 and 8 based on the regression results below.

```{r}
#| eval: false
summary(c1<-felm(nox_emit ~ NBPOperating | 
                   smmXc + smmXy + stXy , 
                 data=df5))
```

**Question 6: According to the regression, the NOx Budget Program was able to reduce NOx emissions by \_\_\_\_\_\_ thousand tons per county-season. (1 point)**

**Question 7: What fixed effects were included in the regression? (3 point)**

Answer:

**Question 8: Based on the regression results in Column 1 through 5, the NOx Budget Program decreased NOx emissions in the average county by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_(minimum value) to \_\_\_\_\_\_(maximum value) tons of NOx per summer. (2 points)**

**Question 9: Because there are 1185 counties regulated by the NOx Budget Program, our results correspond to a total decrease of between \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_(minimum value) to \_\_\_\_\_\_(maximum value) tons of NOx per summer. (4 points)**
